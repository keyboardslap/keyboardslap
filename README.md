Hey, I'm KeyboardSlap. I'm currently a student at UCSD who wishes he was studying computer science. 
I hope to use GitHub to assist my efforts to learn programming, and to show my skills to future prospective employers. 
I also hope to pick up some personal projects soon. 
Some ideas are mods for my favorite games, a program for an Arduino/RPI to monitor the door and window sensors in my house, and maybe a jailbreak tweak. 
I also have some old and admittedly unsophisticated Arduino programs that I'll probably upload for safekeeping. 
Thanks for stopping by! If you have a moment, please consider dropping some career advice, or any advice for that matter.
